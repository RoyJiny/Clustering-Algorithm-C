Performence improvments:

DONE - 1) convert spmat to use char

DONE - 2) change group implementation to use linked lists / arrays / signle array

DONE - 3) change unmoved to just add nodes and not re allocate the list

4) add threshhold to avoid infinite loops

DONE - 5) check if unnorm.. eigen vector is really needed

DONE - 7) reuse g in calculate 1norm

8) change node deleting to be by ref to prev



Issues to check:

DONE - 1) check what is start temp in read input -> it used for storing the data from fread(...)

2) change make rules

3) add exit codes

4) clean code
