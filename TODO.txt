Performence improvments:

DONE - 1) convert spmat to use char

2) change group implementation to use linked lists / arrays / signle array

DONE - 3) change unmoved to just add nodes and not re allocate the list

4) add threshhold to avoid infinite loops



Issues to check:

1) check what is start temp in read input



If there is time:

1) try with array implementation
