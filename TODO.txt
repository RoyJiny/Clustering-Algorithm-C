Performence improvments:

DONE - 1) convert spmat to use char

DONE - 2) change group implementation to use linked lists / arrays / signle array

DONE - 3) change unmoved to just add nodes and not re allocate the list

4) add threshhold to avoid infinite loops

DONE - 5) check if unnorm.. eigen vector is really needed

DONE - 7) reuse g in calculate 1norm

DONE - 8) change node deleting to be by ref to prev



Issues to check:

DONE - 1) check what is start temp in read input -> it used for storing the data from fread(...)

2) change make rules and check includes

DONE - 3) add exit codes

4) clean code: check for unused functions, clean compute_score, change runner names

5) limit the length of functions

idea: 
maybe change compute_modularity_matrix_row to compute the dot product..
B_g * vector = (A - D) * vector... *use A->mult!
need to check the element in position [i][i]...

# remember to remove -g flag from makefile #
